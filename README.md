# OperatingSystems-EX3
Third exercise on Operating Systems course - Departement of Informatics and Telecommunications, National & Kapodistrian Uneversity of Athens.

# Run
**./main SemNum Threshold ProcNum**
- SemNum: number of semaphores created
- Threshold: probability threshold
- ProcNum: number of processes forked by the initial process

# Implementation

This project combines processes, semaphores and priority queues for the simulation of a time scheduling application, where processes can arrive at random intervals - each process has a priority level.  

The report of the project, where the implementation is fully explained, is also uploaded on the repository in Greek.
